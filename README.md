# Bus Tracker
A simple web application that keeps track of last stops and the time of last stops of buses relying on input from the conductor to enable users to search for buses which are approaching their stop and are going to their destination. Also includes a route search for users to see which bus routes would take them from any one stop to another directly(without changing buses).</br>
Data currently added is that of BMTC bus routes and stops.
